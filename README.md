# 🕹️ **Flappy Bird — DQN / Double-DQN**

---

## 📘 **Summary**

This repository implements a compact **Flappy Bird** environment, **DQN / Double-DQN agents**, training & evaluation utilities, and a simple **GUI / console front-end** to run experiments and play the trained agent.

---

## 🔁 **Project Flow**

1. **Configure parameters** in `config.py` — screen, physics, rewards, checkpoint path, training episodes.
2. **Environment (`env.py`)** — concise Gym-like API:  
   `reset() -> state`, `step(action) -> (state, reward, done, info)`.
3. **Agents (`agent.py`, `agent_ddqn.py`)** — define networks, epsilon-greedy action selection, loss computation, and updates.
4. **Replay Buffer (`utils.py`)** — stores transitions and provides random batches for learning.
5. **Training Loop (`train.py`)** — handles warmup, epsilon schedule, environment interaction, updates, logging, and checkpoint saves.
6. **Evaluation / Play (`play.py`)** — runs greedy evaluation episodes with or without rendering (pygame / headless).
7. **Front-ends:**
   - `main.py` — **Tk GUI** for Train / Load+Train / Play (Render / No Render).
   - `console_main.py` — **CLI menu** for headless training (great for servers).
8. **Notebooks** (`flappy-bird-dqn.ipynb`, `double_dqn_train.ipynb`) — alternate training scripts for experimentation or use on Jupyter/Kaggle.

## 📁 **Files and Responsibilities**

### 🧾 `config.py`

- Central configuration: screen size, physics constants, reward shaping, checkpoint paths, and training episodes.
- Edit this file to tune environment and training defaults.

### 🐤 `env.py`

- Implements **FlappyBirdEnv** with deterministic logic.
- API: `reset()`, `step()`, `render()`, `close()`.
- Handles reward shaping, collisions, and fallback to simple shapes if assets are missing.

### 🧠 `agent.py`

- Standard **DQN agent**: policy + target networks, epsilon-greedy selection, `compute_loss()`, `update()`, `save()`, `load()`.
- Uses **soft target updates**. Primary implementation for training.

### 🧩 `agent_ddqn.py`

- **Double-DQN variant** — uses policy net for next-state action selection and target net for evaluation.
- Drop-in replacement for more stable learning.

### 📦 `utils.py`

- **ReplayBuffer**: deque-based, with `push()` and `sample(batch_size)` methods.
- Stores transitions as `Transition` namedtuples.

### 🏋️ `train.py`

- Core **training loop**:  
  `train_loop(num_episodes=..., render=False, resume=False, difficulty="normal")`
- Handles warmup, epsilon decay, training updates, checkpointing, and optional rendering.

### 🎮 `play.py`

- Helpers:
  - `play_model(num_episodes=1, dif="normal", render=True, target_score=1000)` — interactive play.
  - `play_model_no_render(num_episodes=10, target_score=1000, dif="normal")` — headless evaluation + plotting.
- Loads checkpoint automatically from `CHECKPOINT_PATH`.

### 🪟 `main.py`

- **Tkinter GUI** exposing: Train / Load+Train / Play (Render / No Render).
- Redirects `stdout` to GUI console for easy log monitoring.

### 💻 `console_main.py`

- **CLI interface** for headless servers.
- Ideal for remote or lightweight training.

### 📊 `plot.py`

- Quick plotting utility to visualize and compare sample scores.

### 🧠 `agent_ddqn.py`, `double_dqn_train.ipynb`, `flappy-bird-dqn.ipynb`

- Alternate training recipes and experiments for DQN / Double-DQN.

## 🖼️ **Assets**

- Directory: `assets/`
  - Contains images for background, bird, pipes, base, etc.
  - If missing → falls back to minimalistic shape-based rendering.
  - Place image assets next to code for full visual experience.

---

## 💾 **Checkpoints**

- Default checkpoint path: defined in `config.py` → `CHECKPOINT_PATH`.
- Training saves both **policy** and **target** network states.
- GUI and play scripts load automatically from this location.

---

## 💡 **Tips**

- **Headless training:** use `console_main.py` or notebooks with dummy SDL drivers.
- **Fine-tune behavior:** adjust rewards / physics in `config.py`.
- **Stabilize learning:** switch to Double-DQN by importing `agent_ddqn.py`.
- **Monitor performance:** watch `best.pth` and training logs.

---

## 📬 **Next Steps**

- To experiment quickly:
  1. Tweak parameters in `config.py` (e.g. `EPI_NUMS`, learning rate).
  2. Run `console_main.py` to start training.
  3. Monitor checkpoints and scores.
- For visualization, launch `main.py` and interact via GUI.
